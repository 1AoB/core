# .NET UNO Runtime Environment

Support assemblies and tools for the newer cross-platform .NET UNO binding.

Currently only contains code for the `net_basetypes` assembly in the source/basetypes subdirectory, as well as Makefiles to build the `net_uretypes` (for `udkapi`) and `net_oootypes` (for `offapi`) assemblies, using `netmaker` from the codemaker/ module
